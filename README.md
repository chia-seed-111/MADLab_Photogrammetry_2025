Mary Note to Self (May 07)
1. For /pages/app.js: needs to look into a proper method of substituting Git PAT so the token is not exposed. Proxy?
2. For /workflows/photogrammetry.yml: substitute with Mike's Mac (repo > Actions > Runners > Self-hosted Runner)
3. Adding a step to converting .usdz files to other formats
